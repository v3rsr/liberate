## Mint your twitter handle into your wallet and never let anyone deplatform you

We are on a mission to enable everyone to bridge their social graph data from large media platforms to decentralized social networks. Weâ€™ve built a production-ready app that enables people to store Twitter metadata (currently: user handles) in a non-transferable NFT that can be permanently bound to a Lens Profile NFT.

This is a web application that allows users to authenticate with their Twitter account using Next Auth and then connect to their preferred wallet using Wagmi. The app allows users to mint a non-transferable NFT that proves ownership of their Twitter account by interacting with a smart contract.

## Installation and Setup

To install and set up the app, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository from GitHub.
2. Install the dependencies using npm or yarn.
3. Set up a Twitter Developer Account and get the necessary API keys and tokens.
4. Set up a Wagmi account and create a new project to get the API key and API secret key.
5. Set up a blockchain network and deploy the smart contract to mint the NFT.
6. Configure the app by creating a `.env` file and setting the following environment variables:
   - `TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY`: Your Twitter consumer key.
   - `TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET`: Your Twitter consumer secret.
   - `NEXTAUTH_URL`: The URL of your Next Auth server.
   - `WAGMI_API_KEY`: Your Wagmi API key.
   - `WAGMI_API_SECRET`: Your Wagmi API secret.
   - `SMART_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`: The address of the smart contract on the blockchain network.
   - `NETWORK`: The name of the blockchain network (e.g., "rinkeby").
7. Start the app using npm or yarn.
